__?? use time beam__
--> [[Vietnam.pdf|yes, use time beam]]

vietnam: "viet" --> outsiders, "nam" --> south
	==> "southern outsiders"

### dynasties under china
region incorporated into chinese empire ~ 100 a.C.
rule until ~1000
	--> Long decentralized / power struggle period
Independence under Nguyen-Dynasty in 19. century
### colonialism
1860 colonized by france --> exploitation of resources and workers
in WW2 briefly taken control by japan due to germany's victory over france
### communism
1950 war independence leads to split 
	_north_: communist ideology, _south_: western ideology
vietnam war: 1955 - 1975
	won by _communist Vietkong_ ==> Vietnam becomes socialist republic


### what to say:
- Go over every event
- Then go on to highlight where Vietnam was independent

## 3. Economy 
1986: _Đổi Mới_ reforms transform planned economy into free market structure
- liberizing trade, dismantle state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
- kept state intervention in strategic sectors (e.g. power, agriculture)
==> reminiscent of german _social market_

--> socialist republic with "mixed" economy
_business-friendly_ reforms

### what to say
- Keep with slide
- ask people if that seems familiar
## 4. Culture
structure of slides:
	image of graph
	explanation + hypothesis of why it is that way
	example from Hanh
### Hofstede
First compare all aspects to different countries
Only compare to germany in individual points
	![[hofstede_vietnam.png]]
### what to say
- a lot to unpack
- highlight similarities to other SE-Asian countries - except in [[#Uncertainty avoidance]] and [[#Long-Tern Orientation]]

##### Power Distance
- oldest male usually "head of family"
- perhaps rooted in long suppression
	- "Vietnamese are used to strict hierarchical systems"
- high pressure in education, Children need to serve parents
	==> age plays important role in hierarchial system
- _Germany_: Low power distance --> stark contrast
	- 
##### Individualism
_Low_ individualism --> one of the _most_ collectivist societies
_definitely_ rooted in socialist history
- gravitate towards "common goal"

- _Germany_: High Individualism --> again stark contrast

##### Motivation towards Achievement and Success
- Vietnam pretty neutral(40)
	--> generally not driven by competition, instead "work to live"

- education of children with high pressure and high expectations
	--> analog to east-asian cultures
--> rooted in [[#2. history]] and need to achieve living standards (?)
- _Germany_: High MAS --> Very orientated towards and driven by competition

##### Uncertainty avoidance
- *Low* uncertainty avoidance
	- shows in tonal language?
	- People maintain "relaxed attitude" towards rules and principles
		--> spontaniously change paths
- _Germany_ --> very high: 

##### Long-Term Orientation

Both _traditional_ and open to new ideas:
- one should honour and thank his ancestors:
	Bàn Thờ (_include image_)
	--> shrines with pictures of ancestors (with buddha statue)
	food offerings and asking for help 
- See reforms in [[#3. Economy]]

##### Indulgence
- _low score_, about equal to germany
- indicates low emphasis on leisure time
- People feel restrained by social norms
	- example: Hanh

### ?? Language & Communication
Focus on respect and formalities
tonal languge

### Gender roles
- vast difference between male and female expectations
- children are exposed to gender roles early on
- off-the-shelf patriarchism:
	- men supply the family through their work
	- Women have to serve men


## 5. Everyday Life
Hanh: Foreigners super popular
- Great Cuisine (if you like asian food of course)
- Tropical Climate + Beautiful Nature
- Vibrant Culture:
	- Historical Sights, Festivals
- Affordable, qualitative Healthcare

## 6. Take-aways for expansion
_?? move this into their respective slides_
[[#Power Distance]] --> vietnamese workers will stick to given instructions for how to do a task
[[#Individualism]] --> discussions need to reach a common consensus, but once they do, plans get implemented real fast
[[#Motivation towards Achievement and Success]] --> Employees may not be very interested in career (positive and negative aspects)
[[#Uncertainty avoidance]] --> Contracts may be deviated from, and People tend to switch jobs more often => Loads of personnel changes. Key: Develop Trust with employees, personal connections



## notes
- highlight contradictions --> hypothesis about communist system clashing with other systems throughout Vietnam's history
