easiest way to categorize: BOXESSSSS GO BRRRRRRR
but: very inflexible, so always take it with a critical eye!


Language shapes / reflects ways of thinking: 
 ex.: In englisch, "I" is capital, "we" is lowercase


## Hall
Edward T. Hall - some anthropologist

came up with boxes:
### 4 dimensions

#### 1. Time 
example: point to future
##### monochronous time
time is on one line, continuous
==> enables appointments, deadlines, places value on punctuality
typical for western cultures
supports short-time relationships

##### polychronous time
multiple different lines of time, simultaneous
==> places _no_ value on punctuality
	--> instead on people!!
"always on time" --> jumping between timelines
typical for southern countries
more life-long relationships


==> the observer places meaning on 

#### 2. Context
example: closing window

##### low context
majority of information is communicated explicitly
more imperative

##### high context
talk a lot "um den heiÃŸen Brei herum reden"
a lot of information, not necessarily directly related to "goal"
more focus on non-verbal communication
Tonality means _a lot_ 
relationship-oriented


#### 3. Space

(private space) 
setting boundaries to how close someone of a certain relatiship grade is allowed to come
##### more space
e.g. Germany 
more closed doors, smaller encapsulated rooms (==> OOP lul)
minimal interruptions (knocking) 
==> etiquettes for keeping distance

##### less space
larger rooms
more physical context
share food / drinks etc...


#### 4. Information
speed and flow of information

##### slow flow
only one person talking at a time
monochronous, low context cultures

##### fast flow of information
completing each other's sentences1
polychronous, high context cultures


## Hofstede
Geert Hofstede - another anthropologist
the guy's more famous lul

worked at IBM, got to analyze global subsidiaries of IBM
==> came up with his own dimensions (first 4, then 6)

He published all his material and data
$+$ Website with comparison tools

### Power Distance (PD)
degree of inequality that exists and is accepted between poeple with and without power

### Individualism (IDV)
"I" vs "we" society
the higher the score, the more individual-focused the country is
based on Human Rights Index, relationships etc.
shows in language

### MAS - Motivation towards Achievement and Success
originally named "Masculinity" - because these aspects are generally attributed to males

### Uncertainty Avoidance (UA)
example: Insurance for stuff (avoids uncertainty)


## (newer dimensions)
### Long Term Orientation
Traditions, Savings...

### Indulgence
How much do you enjoy life?
"satisfy desires" / "luxury"
	--> connected to leisure time, "treats"
